# hi, i am Ajay

a computer science student passionate about algorithms, problem-solving, and theoretical foundations.

currently diving deep into competitive programming, data structures, and discrete mathematics. i spend most of my time solving problems on codeforces and exploring algorithmic challenges.

in my free time, i build backend systems and experiment with go and typescript.

## what i work with

**core focus**: algorithms, data structures, discrete mathematics, graph theory  
**languages**: c++ (competitive programming), go, typescript  
**also exploring**: distributed systems, backend development

## when i am not coding

- solving problems on [codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/aj4y)
- studying computer science theory
- contributing to open-source
- building side projects
