  DSA or Development - What Should You Do as a Freshman?

</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been asked this question many times by friends:<br>
<strong>What should I do as a freshman, DSA or Development?</strong></p>
<p>Here’s what I think.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="heading" id="for-those-who-havent-done-any-programming-yet">
  For Those Who Haven’t Done Any Programming Yet
  <a class="anchor" href="#for-those-who-havent-done-any-programming-yet">#</a>
</h2>
<p>If you haven’t done any programming until now, just focus on learning the fundamentals first.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“PAR KIDHAR SE???”<br>
(Translation: “But from where???”)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you have a ton of time (just me being illogically hyper), I’d recommend <strong>CS50x by David Malan</strong>. It’s a great course that teaches the fundamentals of Computer Science (and no, Computer Science is not the same as programming).</p>
<p>But if you want to get into programming quickly, start with <strong>C++</strong>.<br>
(And by the way, just pronounce it as “cpp”, it sounds better.)</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="heading" id="why-c">
  Why C++
  <a class="anchor" href="#why-c">#</a>
</h2>
<p>You might be thinking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Why C++? Why not Python, JavaScript, or C?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s go through them one by one.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="why-not-c">
  Why Not C
  <a class="anchor" href="#why-not-c">#</a>
</h3>
<p>You can go with C if you want. It’s close to the machine and helps you understand how computers actually work.<br>
But if I were you, I’d go with <strong>C++</strong>, because it’s basically C with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better abstraction and cleaner syntax</li>
<li>Optional Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</li>
<li>The Standard Template Library (STL), which makes life much easier when you get into DSA or Competitive Programming</li>
<li>The same low-level control as C</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="heading" id="why-not-java">
  Why Not Java
  <a class="anchor" href="#why-not-java">#</a>
</h3>
<p>You can also go with Java, but here’s why I wouldn’t:</p>
<ul>
<li>Java forces you into OOP from day one. C++ gives you freedom. You can write procedural, modular, or object-oriented code as you like.</li>
<li>The C++ community for DSA and CP is much larger, and finding help or resources is easier.</li>
<li>And honestly, most people hate Java. (kidding&hellip; mostly)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3 class="heading" id="why-not-python-or-javascript">
  Why Not Python or JavaScript
  <a class="anchor" href="#why-not-python-or-javascript">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Because they make things a bit too easy.</p>
<p>They’re high-level languages, far from the machine. They let you do a lot, but they hide how things actually work underneath. You don’t really get to understand why something works the way it does, and that’s something beginners should focus on.</p>
<p>Of course, Python and JavaScript are useful and popular, but learn them <strong>after</strong> you’re comfortable with the fundamentals in a lower-level language like C++.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="heading" id="where-to-learn-c">
  Where to Learn C++
  <a class="anchor" href="#where-to-learn-c">#</a>
</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you like reading, follow <strong><a href="https://learncpp.com">learncpp.com</a></strong>. It’s one of the best written resources out there.</li>
<li>If you prefer video tutorials, check out <strong>The Cherno’s C++ playlist on YouTube</strong>. It’s beginner-friendly and keeps you motivated early on.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re completely new, I’d recommend starting with The Cherno’s videos. They’re practical and easy to follow.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="heading" id="what-if-you-already-know-the-fundamentals">
  What If You Already Know the Fundamentals
  <a class="anchor" href="#what-if-you-already-know-the-fundamentals">#</a>
</h2>
<p>That depends on where you are in your journey.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="if-youre-just-starting-college">
  If You’re Just Starting College
  <a class="anchor" href="#if-youre-just-starting-college">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Spend the first month or two exploring different domains like web development, mobile apps, data science, algorithms, or AI and ML.<br>
If you find something you genuinely like, focus on it and go deeper.</p>
<p>You’ll eventually need to learn DSA and solve Leetcode-style problems, but that can come later. If you’re enjoying what you’re doing, don’t worry about the rest for now.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="heading" id="if-you-cant-decide-what-to-do">
  If You Can’t Decide What to Do
  <a class="anchor" href="#if-you-cant-decide-what-to-do">#</a>
</h3>
<p>If you’re thinking, “I can’t decide what to do, just tell me what to start with,” then I’ll be blunt:<br>
Start with <strong>Competitive Programming (CP)</strong>.</p>
<p>Why? Because it builds your problem-solving and pattern recognition skills.<br>
Development is also mostly pattern recognition. If you can think logically and solve problems efficiently, you’ll do well in any field.</p>
<p>Tech stacks and frameworks change constantly, but strong fundamentals and problem-solving skills never go out of demand.</p>
<p>Once you’re comfortable with CP and thinking logically, you can easily move into development. By then, you’ll be able to implement your ideas effectively.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="heading" id="getting-started-with-competitive-programming">
  Getting Started with Competitive Programming
  <a class="anchor" href="#getting-started-with-competitive-programming">#</a>
</h2>
<ul>
<li>Start with <strong><a href="https://codeforces.com/">Codeforces</a></strong>. It’s one of the best platforms for CP.</li>
<li>You’ll handle low-rated problems easily if you know basic high-school math.</li>
<li>Don’t try to learn all data structures and algorithms upfront. Start solving problems and learn algorithms only when you need them.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="heading" id="recommended-resources">
  Recommended Resources
  <a class="anchor" href="#recommended-resources">#</a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://usaco.guide/">USACO Guide</a></li>
<li><em>Competitive Programmer’s Handbook</em> by Antti Laaksonen (open source)</li>
<li><a href="https://cp-algorithms.com/">CP-Algorithms</a></li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 class="heading" id="after-youre-comfortable-with-cp">
  After You’re Comfortable with CP
  <a class="anchor" href="#after-youre-comfortable-with-cp">#</a>
</h2>
<p>After 4 to 5 months of regular CP, start exploring development or project building.</p>
<p>And it doesn’t have to be web development. You can build a compiler, CLI tools(just do it, things start panning out in no time), a physics engine(I saw some projects here and there regarding it, and yep, they were so cool), or anything else that interests you. There’s a lot to explore if you keep looking around.</p>
<hr>
<h2 class="heading" id="final-words">
  Final Words
  <a class="anchor" href="#final-words">#</a>
</h2>
<p>At last, I&rsquo;ll quote <a href="https://x.com/alia0209">alia</a>-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>capabilities are not your current skills, capabilities are what you are capable of</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So just start, you&rsquo;ll figure it out along the way. <br></p>
<p>That’s all for now. I’ve spammed quite a lot :P</p>
<p>I’ll add more if I remember something useful later.
Thanks for reading and sticking with me.</p>
